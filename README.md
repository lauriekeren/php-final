# php-final-1
Mortgage Loan Calculator
<p>This is my final project for my PHP 1 class, summer term. </p>

<p>Once I figured out the numbers, I originally formatted the amortization table as an HTML table, and I have an example of that version on github. I decided to work on learning CSS grid, so I did some re-working, and this version uses CSS grid. </p>
